# Minotaur

A game about escaping the Minotaur's labyrinth. One player is the Minotaur that chases the hero and the other is the hero who is attempting to escape the labyrinth.

The game ends when the Minotaur touches the hero.

The labyrinth is invisible to both players.

The hero can place torches that reveal the surrounding area to both players, and the Minotaur can check how close their location is to an exit (the status of which is revealed to both players).
