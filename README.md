# Minotaur

A tiny project to learn Rust. Is not meant to be flexible or especially well-made; is just a small test-project.

A game about escaping the Minotaur's labyrinth. One player is the Minotaur that chases the hero and the other is the hero who is attempting to escape the labyrinth.

The game ends when the Minotaur touches the hero or the hero touches the exit.

The labyrinth is invisible to both players.

The hero can place torches that reveal the surrounding area to both players, and the Minotaur can check reveal whether their surrounding area has an exit or not to both players.
